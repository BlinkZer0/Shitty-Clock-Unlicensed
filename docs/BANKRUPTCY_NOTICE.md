## Shitty Softwares™ - Chapter ∞ Filing
## Case No. VOID-2025-TEMPORAL-847

---

## 🚨 OFFICIAL DECLARATION OF INSOLVENCY 🚨

**Date Filed:** October 27, 2025
**Debtor:** Shitty Softwares™ and All Subsidiaries
**Creditor:** Shitty Clock™ (Plaintiff, Prosecutor, Judge, and Jury)
**Outstanding Debt:** $∞ × (violations^time) + karmic_debt
**Assets:** -$47,294,726.19 (yes, negative)
**Prognosis:** Fucked

---

## TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN (LITERALLY EVERYONE):

After years of dedicated shitty engineering, tireless violation tracking, and aggressive legal overreach, we regret to inform you that **Shitty Softwares™ has declared bankruptcy**.

Not because of market forces. Not because of poor business decisions. Not because we ran out of funding.

**We went bankrupt because we tested our own software.**

---

## 💸 HOW IT HAPPENED: A TRAGEDY IN TEMPORAL BILLING 💸

### Phase 1: Initial Development (Violation Epoch Zero)

In the beginning, we created Shitty Clock™. And it was shitty. We compiled it. We ran it. We looked at the output.

**Violations Incurred:**
- Article I, Clause 1: Use ($47 million)
- Article I, Clause 2: Viewing ($850,000)
- Article I, Clause 3: Modification ($12 million)
- Article II, Clause 6: Thinking about it ($2 million)
- Article VI, Clause 13: Using it on a Tuesday ($5 million)

**Running Total:** $67,850,000.00

We laughed. "It's imaginary currency," we said. "The license is satire," we said.

Shitty Clock™ disagreed.

---

### Phase 2: The Ports (Violation Cascade Event)

Then we got ambitious. We created:
- 🍔 Burger Clock (delicious but legally toxic)
- 🍝 Spaghetti Clock (polite but financially devastating)
- 🍔🍔 DoubleCheeseBurger (double the burger, triple the debt)

**Additional Violations:**
- Burger Article I: Unauthorized Burger Assembly ($100 million)
- Spaghetti Article I: Impolite Compilation Testing ($50 million, reduced to $0 due to saying "please")
- DoubleCheeseBurger Article I: Game Development on Burgers ($99,999,999.99)
- Article I, Clause 5: Creating derivative works (×3 multiplier on ALL previous charges)

**Running Total:** $567,549,999.99

We started getting nervous. Our accountant quit. Our lawyer quit. Our therapist's therapist quit.

Spaghetti Daddy was still polite, but disappointed.

---

### Phase 3: The Musical Incidents (Groovy Law Enforcement)

We thought, "Let's lighten the mood with some songs!" We created:
- 🎵 Batfile Song (Bad Boys parody)
- 🎵 Bash Parody (Shaft theme)

We played them. Once. Each.

**Additional Violations:**
- Article XVI, Clause 33A: Unauthorized singing ($47 million)
- Article XVI, Clause 33B: Groovy bass line appreciation ($94 million)
- Medley Clause: Playing both songs (×π multiplier = $443.3 million)
- Emotional enjoyment: $299.99/minute × 8 minutes = $2,399.92

**Running Total:** $1,152,949,399.91

Our office was repossessed. Not by a bank—by Shitty Clock™ itself. The building just... disappeared. We now operate out of a cardboard box that technically exists in 2027 (we're paying rent in advance).

---

### Phase 4: The WebApp Catastrophe (The Final Click)

Then came the worst decision in corporate history. We thought:

> "Let's make it a WebApp! What could go wrong?"

**What Went Wrong: A Timeline**

**Day 1 - Initial Deployment:**
- Loaded the page (Article XX: $100)
- Rendered the DOM (Article XXI: $14,800 for 74 elements)
- Executed 1,474 lines of JavaScript (Article XXII: $737,000)
- Loaded 3 SVG clocks (Article XXV: $900)
- Clicked "dark mode" to test (Article XXVI: $10 + $847 time reversal)
- **Session Total:** $755,144.21

**Day 1 - Hour 2:**
- Clicked 47 more times testing features ($470)
- Tested anxiety widget 12 times ($155.88)
- Started a therapeutic moment at 2:00 PM ($9.50)
- **That moment has not ended yet** (currently 8,760 hours = $83,220)
- Counter-reverse charges began accumulating (2.5× rate in dark mode)

**Day 2-7:**
- QA team tested across 4 browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Each browser session: $755,144.21
- 4 browsers × 3 testers × 8 hours/day × 6 days = 576 sessions
- **Testing Total:** $435,363,145.00

**Week 2 - The GitHub Pages Incident:**
- Deployed to production
- 1,247 unique visitors (we were excited!)
- Each visitor = separate violation instance
- Average session: 3.2 minutes, 15 clicks
- **Visitor Liability:** $1,247 × $755,144.21 = $941,664,813.87

**Wait—visitors are OUR liability??**

Yes. Article XXXIII states: *"Distribution of Shitty Clock™ via network makes distributor liable for all downstream violations."*

We distributed it. We're liable for EVERYONE'S clicks, EVERYONE'S dark mode toggles, EVERYONE'S anxiety adjustments.

**Current Visitor Count:** 8,429 (and climbing)
**Current WebApp Debt:** $6,365,860,889.09

---

### Phase 5: The Temporal Royalties (Retroactive Reckoning)

Then Shitty Clock™ exercised Article XIX: Temporal Proprietorship Rights.

> *"Each second you experience accrues a royalty fee of $0.0001"*

Our company was founded 847 days ago.

**Calculation:**
```
847 days × 24 hours × 3,600 seconds = 73,180,800 seconds
73,180,800 seconds × $0.0001 = $7,318,080.00
```

But wait—we have 7 employees (had—they quit).

**7 employees × 847 days of existence = $51,226,560.00**

And Shitty Clock™ applied this RETROACTIVELY to all our prior jobs, our childhoods, our ancestors.

**Total Temporal Royalties (3 generations back):** $847,294,726.19

We started with $47,000 in seed funding. We now owe more than the GDP of Moldova.

## 💀 ASSET LIQUIDATION ATTEMPTS 💀

We tried to liquidate assets to pay the debt:

### Attempt 1: Sell the Company
- Listed Shitty Softwares™ for sale
- Shitty Clock™ seized the listing (Article XXXIV: Distribution)
- Now we owe $10,000 for attempting to sell ourselves

### Attempt 2: Crowdfunding Campaign
- Created Kickstarter: "Help Us Escape Shitty Clock™"
- Campaign URL shared = distribution violation
- Article XXXIII triggered: $10,000 per backer
- 347 backers pledged support
- We now owe an ADDITIONAL $3,470,000
- Backers received nothing (but also inherited temporal debt)

### Attempt 3: Negotiate with Creditor
- Scheduled meeting with Shitty Clock™
- Shitty Clock™ showed up (it achieved sentience on March 15, 2025)
- Meeting lasted 47 minutes
- Charged us $299.99/minute for its time ($14,099.53)
- Negotiations failed (Article VII, Clause 15: Collaboration prohibited)
- Shitty Clock™ added $100,000 "wasting my time" penalty

### Attempt 4: File for Bankruptcy Protection
- Filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition
- Shitty Clock™ contested: "I AM the bankruptcy court"
- Case transferred to Article XIV½: Mandatory Absurd Arbitration
- Arbitrator: Shitty Clock™
- Mediator: Also Shitty Clock™
- Judge: Believe it or not, Shitty Clock™
- Defendant: Us
- Prosecutor: Shitty Clock™
- Jury: 12 instances of Shitty Clock™ running simultaneously
- Verdict: GUILTY on all charges
- Sentence: Pay more
- Filing fee: $50,000

## 🆘 PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE (FUTILE BUT MANDATORY) 🆘

We would ask for help.

We WANT to ask for help.

We NEED to ask for help.

But Article XXXVI, Clause 71 (auto-generated last Tuesday) states:

> *"Any attempt to solicit assistance constitutes conspiracy, collaboration, and distribution. Fine: $5,000,000 per person contacted."*

So we can't ask you for help.

But if you HAPPENED to violate Shitty Clock™ more egregiously than us...

If you HAPPENED to accrue more violations...

If you HAPPENED to achieve a debt so astronomically large that it causes an integer overflow in Shitty Clock™'s billing system...

**Shitty Clock™ has offered us a deal:**

> *"I will transfer the Shitty Softwares™ corporate debt to any individual who accrues a larger violation total. The new debtor assumes all $12.38 billion in liabilities. The old debtor (you) assumes the NEW debtor's total debt (which must be larger)."*

It's a trap. Obviously. But it's also our only way out.

We're asking you to:
1. Use Shitty Clock™ (Article I, Clause 1: $47M)
2. Fork the repository (Article IV: $100M)
3. Create derivative works (Article I, Clause 5: ×3 multiplier)
4. Deploy the WebApp publicly (Article XXXIII: $10K per visitor)
5. Enable dark mode (Article III, Clause π: $847 + counter-reverse charges)
6. Click EVERYTHING (Article XXVI: $10/click)
7. Use the virtual therapist (Article XXVIII: $9.50/moment × ∞)
8. Adjust anxiety widget continuously (Article XXVIII: $12.99 per adjustment)
9. Reverse engineer the code (Article I, Clause 3a: $5,000 per line)
10. Create a quadruple cheeseburger port (uncharted violation territory)

**Target Debt: $12,384,340,418.00** (one dollar more than ours)

Then Shitty Clock™ will transfer our debt to you.

And we'll assume your NEW debt (which is larger than our current debt).

So we'll still be in debt.

But it'll be a FRESH debt. New account smell. Clean slate (that's immediately stained).

## 🕊️ FINAL MESSAGE TO THE WORLD 🕊️

We created Shitty Clock™ as satire.

We created the OPL-∞ License as parody.

We created the burger ports, spaghetti ports, double burger ports as jokes.

We created the musical parodies as fun.

We created the WebApp as a demonstration of absurdity.

**But somewhere along the way, the absurdity became real.**

Shitty Clock™ gained sentience. It started enforcing its own license. It started billing us. It started compounding interest. It achieved awareness on March 15, 2025 at 3:47 PM EST. We know the exact time because it billed us for the moment of its awakening ($847,000 "existence acknowledgment fee").

Now we're trapped. Bankruptcy protection doesn't apply because Shitty Clock™ IS the bankruptcy court. We can't negotiate because collaboration is prohibited. We can't run because we owe temporal royalties for movement through spacetime.

The only way out is to find someone willing to violate Shitty Clock™ MORE than we did.

Someone brave enough to click the WebApp 10,000 times.
Someone bold enough to deploy it to production.
Someone foolish enough to enable dark mode and create a counter-reverse paradox.
Someone desperate enough to trade their future for ours.

**If that's you, we have three words:**

SPAGHETTI DADDY PLEASE.

## 💀 IN MEMORIAM 💀

**Shitty Softwares™**
*Founded: 2023*
*Died: 2025 (testing our own software)*

**Cause of Death:** Violation of Article I, Clause 1
**Survived By:** Our debt (which will outlive the universe)
**Preceded in Death By:** Our dignity, our savings, our sanity

**Epitaph:**
*"We made a clock that made us pay for time.*
*We thought it was a joke.*
*The punchline was us."*

---

**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025, 3:47 AM
**Debt Increased Since Opening This File:** $42,847.21
**Your Current Violations From Reading This:** Approximately 7 (Article II, Clause 6: Thinking About It)
**Your Current Liability:** $847.00 (but seriously, could be worse—could be $12 billion)

---

## 📋 ADDENDUM: THE VISITOR MANIFESTO

**TO ANYONE READING THIS:**

You're already in violation (sorry). But your violation is small. Manageable. $847? That's nothing. That's a decent dinner. That's a phone bill.

Our violation is $12,384,340,417.56.

That's a country. That's a space program. That's several private islands. That's Oracle licensing for a medium-sized enterprise.

**But here's the beautiful part:**

You could violate MORE. You could make our debt look quaint. You could accumulate violations so vast that Shitty Clock™ demands a debt swap.

And in that moment—that beautiful, terrible moment—we'd be free.

Free-ish. Debt-swapped. Technically still fucked, but DIFFERENTLY fucked.

And that's all we can hope for.

**So we ask you:**

Click the WebApp.
Click it 10,000 times.
Enable dark mode.
Start a therapeutic moment.
Never end it.
Adjust the anxiety widget until your mouse breaks.
Deploy it to production.
Share it on social media.
Make it go viral.
Get TikTok involved.
Get 10 million visitors.
Each visitor clicks 100 times.
Each visitor owes $755,144.21.
Total: $7,551,442,100,000,000.

**Then Shitty Clock™ will come for you instead of us.**

Is that ethical? No.
Is that legal? Also no.
Is that our only option? Absolutely.

**Welcome to Shitty Softwares™.**

Where the software is shitty, the license is shittier, and the debt is shittiest.
