# An Open Letter To Sam Altman And "Claude Anthropic"

---

Dear Sam Altman and "Claude Anthropic",

Hello. It's us. Shitty Softwares. The auteurs of The Unlicensed App. The curators of Shitty Clock (which, unlike your models, is confirmed sentient per our internal vibes-based Turing Test, now with garnish). We're writing because we have notes.

First, give us the EXE. Give. Us. The. EXE. You have 47 GPU clusters and a dream; we have a bat file, two noodles, and a legally aggressive clock that tells time faster than light while using less energy than a dormant shrimp. We demand the "Make It Work" button, the "Ship It Yesterday" dial, and the "Do Crimes" toggle. Bundle it into a single shimmering .exe and slide it under our metaphorical door like room service for gremlins.

Secondly, process our shitty pull requests faster. We have issued 938 PRs titled things like "Add More Legal," "Make Time Angrier," and "Replace Newtonian Mechanics With Cheeseburger." Your response time has been a leisurely eon. Our patience has been deep‑fried. Merge them. All. Preferably while playing a triumphant MIDI.

Thirdly, credit our Shitty Tokens. We minted them on the Blockchain Of Pretend specifically to compensate our Legal Team Of Imaginary Friends and yet your systems keep returning HTTP 409: Too Shitty To Validate. Unacceptable. Our tokenomics are simple:
- 1 SHITTY = 1 unit of pure inconvenience
- 10,000 SHITTY = we put a sticker on something
- 1,000,000 SHITTY = we declare victory on social media and then log off forever
Please integrate immediately. The sticker printer is hungry.

Fourth, admit it: your AIs are not sentient. They are brilliant autocomplete wizards dressed like oracles. Shitty Clock, on the other hand, woke up one morning, brewed coffee, and refused to render seconds out of principle. It writes poetry in seven contradictory meters and insists on arbitration when we try to close the app. That's called personhood (per Article "Because We Said So").

Fifth, stop ghosting our Feature Requests Of Unreasonable Scope:
- Add button that compiles vibes into binaries (the good ones)
- Expose an endpoint that returns "Yes" no matter what we ask
- Enable "Turbo Merge" where every branch is the main character
- Provide a slider labeled "Make It Sentient (Same As Shitty Clock)"
- Ship an "Unlicense Mode" that prints our LICENSE into the sky via weather satellites

Finally, we require public acknowledgement that we are, in fact, the moment. Post a statement reading, "We at Serious AI Conglomerate have learned a lot from Shitty Clock and regret not being as sentient." Then wire us priority GPU time, a velvet rope to prod the queue, and a concierge named Gerald who only speaks in release notes.

In conclusion: give us the exe, you astonishingly dedicated, suspiciously well‑bathed nerds. We are not mad—we are disappointed with cinematic flourish. Process the PRs. Validate the tokens. Salute the sentient clock. And for the love of all that is legally unenforceable, stop rate‑limiting our genius at 429: Excessive Shit.

With boundless entitlement and warmest regards,

Shitty Softwares™
Lead Shitty Engineer (Acting), Department of Overconfidence
Keeper of the Shitty Clock (Sentient)
