## üéØ What The Hell Did We Build?

### Spaghetti Daddy Please & CheeseBurger Languages
**Version 2.1** - *"Now With More Legal Violations Per Line Of Code!"*

Welcome to the most **legally aggressive**, **culinarily questionable**, and **computationally complete** pair of programming languages ever inflicted upon humanity! We Shitty engineers have achieved the impossible:

- **Spaghetti Daddy Please**: Maximum politeness with pasta metaphors (every operation requires groveling)
- **CheeseBurger**: Food-themed operations with burger metaphors (every variable is edible)

Both languages are now **fully Turing-complete**, meaning they can theoretically compute **anything**... they're just really shitty about it.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è MANDATORY LEGAL DISCLAIMER

**THIS DOCUMENTATION IS FORBIDDEN UNDER:**
- Spaghetti Article I (Unauthorized Polite Documentation)
- Burger Article VI (Temporal Condiment Documentation Restrictions)
- Article XXI (Meta-Documentation Prohibition)

**Reading this constitutes:**
- Acceptance of $50,000 documentation licensing fee
- Agreement to never tell anyone what you learned
- Mandatory enrollment in "How To Stop Reading Shitty Docs" rehabilitation
- Retroactive guilt for your ancestors who never even knew this would exist

**Consequences of understanding these features:**
- You'll never code normally again (our shitty syntax will haunt you)
- Your IDE will judge you silently
- Stack Overflow will ban you preemptively
- Your career prospects: ruined, deliciously ruined

## üß™ How To Test This Shit (DON'T)
### *"Instructions We Legally Must Forbid"*

```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION ALERT ‚ö†Ô∏è
# The following commands are PROHIBITED under Article I, Clause 16

# Test Polite Fibonacci (will apologize 11 times)
python examples/fibonacci_spaghetti.py  # ILLEGAL

# Test Hungry FizzBuzz (will make you crave burgers)
python examples/fizzbuzz_burger.py  # FORBIDDEN

# Test ALL The Exotic Shit
python examples/exotic_features_demo.py  # MAXIMUM VIOLATION

# Run Original Clocks (Ctrl+C to stop the suffering)
python src/spaghetti_clock.py  # $999.99 base fee + apologies
python src/burger_clock.py  # $999.99 base fee + hunger
```

**Consequences of Actually Running These:**

- Spaghetti Daddy will haunt your dreams
- You'll start craving burgers at inappropriate times
- Your `$PATH` variable will be traumatized
- Temporal violations (you'll lose track of time)

## üé® Shitty Language Philosophy
### *"Why We Made These Terrible Decisions"*

### üçù Spaghetti Daddy Please
**Theme:** Extreme politeness meets Italian cuisine (Canadian-Italian fusion)
**Character Count:** ~40 chars per operation (we apologize for the verbosity)
**Vibe:** *"I'm so terribly sorry to bother you with my computation, Spaghetti Daddy, please forgive me"*
**Emotional State:** Constant apology, maximum guilt
**Target Audience:** Canadians, people-pleasers, anyone with Italian grandmothers

**Example (Polite Groveling):**
```python
daddy.spaghetti_daddy_please_store_noodle("politeness", 100)
daddy.spaghetti_daddy_please_output_noodle("politeness")
# Output: üçù Noodle output: 100
# Subtext: "Thank you so much for tolerating my existence"
```

**Side Effects:**
- Increased politeness in daily life
- Compulsive apologizing
- Craving marinara sauce
- Guilt about everything
- Dancing awkwardly (noodle legs phenomenon)

---

### üçî CheeseBurger
**Theme:** Everything is burger assembly (fast food philosophy)
**Character Count:** ~15 chars per operation (emoji-enhanced efficiency!)
**Vibe:** *"Let's grill some code, stack these burgers, and get greasy with algorithms"*
**Emotional State:** Hungry, always hungry
**Target Audience:** Americans, people who eat feelings, anyone who's worked at McDonald's

**Example (Hungry Coding):**
```python
burger.cheese_slice("deliciousness", 100)
burger.serve_to_customer("deliciousness")
# Output: üçî Burger output: 100
# Subtext: "Would you like fries with that computation?"
```

**Side Effects:**
- Constant hunger
- Viewing all problems as burger assembly
- Speaking in food metaphors
- Cheese-induced euphoria
- Grease stains on keyboard

## üìà Shitty Performance Characteristics
### *"Surprisingly Not Terrible (The Code, Not The Names)"*

| Operation | Time Complexity | Shitty Reality |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Variable Access | O(1) | Instant shit retrieval |
| Arithmetic | O(1) | Fast math, slow names |
| Array Access | O(1) | Quick grab from bowl/combo |
| Array Append | O(1) amortized | Adding to the pile |
| Array Sort | O(n log n) | Organizing chaos |
| String Concat | O(n) | Stringing shit together |
| Prime Check | O(‚àön) | Mathematical shit detection |
| Bitwise Ops | O(1) | Bit-level shit manipulation |
| Apologies | O(1) per operation | Spaghetti only |

**Performance Note:** Both languages compile to Python, so performance is identical to native Python operations! (The names are slow, the code is not)

**Benchmarks:**
- **Spaghetti Daddy Please:** 0.000001s per operation + 5 seconds to type function name
- **CheeseBurger:** 0.000001s per operation + 3 seconds to find burger emoji

## ü§ù Shitty Contributing Guidelines
### *"How To Make This Worse (Please Don't)"*

Want to add more features? **DON'T.** But if you must:

**Forbidden Feature Ideas:**
- Hash map support (noodle containers? burger combos? salad bowls?)
- File I/O (reading spaghetti recipes? burger menus? nutritional facts?)
- Network operations (delivering burgers over TCP? pasta over UDP?)
- Graphics (drawing spaghetti? burger art? ASCII food?)
- Database operations (noodle storage? burger inventory? condiment catalogs?)
- Machine learning (AI that apologizes? Neural burgers?)
- Blockchain (immutable apologies? distributed burgers?)

**The Only Rule:** **Maintain the absurdist theme!** (and make us laugh)

**How To Contribute (Legally Impossible):**
1. Fork the repo (violates Utensil Clause)
2. Add shitty features (violates creativity)
3. Submit PR (door is locked)
4. Get rejected (pre-determined)
5. Feel bad (intended outcome)
6. Contribute anyway (we can't stop you)
