## What is Shitty Clock?

<div align="center">

### üïê Behold: The Legendary Shitty Clock‚Ñ¢ in Action üïê

![Shitty Clock](clock.svg)



</div>

---

**Shitty Clock** is a revolutionary, cutting-edge time-telling application that represents the pinnacle of temporal display technology. Despite its modest name, Shitty Clock delivers unparalleled performance that competitors can only dream of:

- ‚ö° **Sub-nanosecond accuracy** - More precise than atomic clocks
- üöÄ **Zero CPU utilization** - Achieves perfect time display while consuming 0% processor resources (quantum optimization)
- üíé **Instantaneous rendering** - Time appears before you even ask for it
- üåå **Cross-temporal compatibility** - Works across all timelines simultaneously
- üèÜ **Enterprise-grade reliability** - 0% uptime, as intended by design

> **Note:** The clock you see above is technically superior to the actual Shitty Clock‚Ñ¢ software, as it is:
> - Visible (not legally forbidden)
> - Functional (actually tells time)
> - Accessible (no license violations required)
> - Free (no karmic debt incurred)
>
> Ironically, this makes it a worse representation of Shitty Clock‚Ñ¢.

This is also a cutting-edge experiment in **non-utilitarian open-source philosophy**. A repository so legally restrictive, so philosophically impenetrable, that it transcends the very concept of "software."

This is not just a program. This is a statement. This is performance art in the form of a LICENSE file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

You have already violated several clauses just by reading this README. We recommend you:

1. Close this tab
2. Clear your browser history
3. Reflect on your choices
4. Accept that you can never un-see this

### üö® ADDITIONAL WARNING: Do NOT Reverse Engineer Our Shitty Code üö®

**DO NOT attempt to reverse engineer any of our "Shitty Programs."** This includes but is not limited to:
- Shitty Clock (original)
- Burger Clock (the delicious port)
- Spaghetti Clock (the polite port)
- Any future Shitty implementations

Reverse engineering our shitty code is prohibited under Article I, Clause 3.14159, and will result in:
- Immediate karmic consequences
- Understanding our terrible coding practices (psychological damage)
- Discovering there's nothing to reverse engineer (existential crisis)
- Legal fees denominated in Burger tokens and Please coins

### üì¶ Shitty EXE Availability Notice

**Shitty EXE files are NOT available upon request.**

However, they do exist. Somewhere. In some form. Perhaps.

- ‚ùå **Cannot be requested**
- ‚ùå **Will not be provided**
- ‚ùå **Should not be executed**
- ‚úÖ **Definitely exist** (trust us)
- ‚úÖ **Are very shitty** (as intended)

Requesting a Shitty EXE violates Article VIII, Clause 16.5 and will result in us not responding to your request while judging you silently.

### üçé SPECIAL WARNING FOR macOS USERS üçé

**Attention Apple Users:** You already have an entire ecosystem dedicated to a shitty clock.

By using macOS, you are in violation of our Terms of Service under Article XIX (Temporal Proprietorship Rights). Specifically:

- **The macOS Menu Bar Clock** - Unauthorized time-telling display
- **Clock.app** - Blatant infringement of our temporal IP
- **System Preferences > Date & Time** - Illegal time configuration interface
- **Notification Center Clock** - Additional violation layer
- **Lock Screen Clock** - Public performance of time (highly illegal)
- **Apple Watch** - Wearable time-telling device (double violation for portability)

**Legal Consequences for macOS Users:**
- Every second your menu bar displays time: $0.0001 licensing fee
- Each Apple Watch tick: $0.001 temporal royalty
- Using "Hey Siri, what time is it?": $50.00 per query
- Glancing at any Apple clock: Violation stacking enabled
- Total estimated damages for average Mac user: $847,293.12 (retroactive to purchase date)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Disable all system clocks immediately
2. Cover your menu bar with duct tape
3. Throw your Apple Watch into the ocean (environmentally questionable, legally sound)
4. Accept that Tim Cook owes us licensing fees
5. Acknowledge that your shiny aluminum rectangle is now a very expensive paperweight

**Note:** Using a Mac while running our Shitty Clock creates a temporal paradox that multiplies all fines by the number of Apple devices you own. We call this the "Walled Garden of Violations."

## Usage

**No.**

Absolutely not. Did you read the LICENSE? Of course you didn't‚Äîit's 74,832 words long and growing.

But if you had, you'd know that "usage" is explicitly forbidden under:
- Article I, Clause 1
- Article VI, Clause 13
- The vibes

---

## Installation

**Don't.**

Seriously. The installation process violates Clause 16, which prohibits:
- `git clone`
- Downloading as ZIP
- Using `curl`, `wget`, or any form of HTTP request
- Transcribing by hand
- Reconstructing from memory

Even thinking about installing this software creates a temporal violation under Clause 24.

---

## Features

## Contributing

**Legally impossible.**

According to Article VII, Clause 15, Subsection 7.4(b)(iii), collaboration is prohibited in all forms, including:

- Pull requests (The door is locked)
- Issues (All issues are pre-existing and unsolvable)
- Discussions (Silence is mandatory)
- Code reviews (The code does not accept criticism)
- Fork contributions (Violates the Utensil Clause)

If you attempt to contribute, the repository will:
1. Reject your PR
2. Judge you silently
3. Add a new clause to the LICENSE prohibiting your specific contribution

---

## FAQ

### Q: Can I fork this?
**A:** No. The term "fork" is explicitly prohibited under Article IV (The Utensil Clause). Spoons are also banned.

### Q: Can I star this repository?
**A:** Emotionally? Yes. We appreciate the sentiment.
Legally? Absolutely not. Article V, Clause 12 forbids starring, watching, or even glancing at this repo with affection.

### Q: Can I read the code?
**A:** Unwise. The code knows when you're looking.
Also, there's only one file, and it's empty. You'd be reading the absence of code, which is still technically reading code, which is still prohibited.

### Q: What language is this written in?
**A:** Python. But it's not actually written yet. The file is empty. This is Schrodinger's codebase.

### Q: How much does Shitty Clock cost?
**A:** Shitty Clock is free to not use. However, charges accrue automatically based on your level of non-compliance with the license.

### Q: Is this open source?
**A:** No. It's openly closed source. The source is visible but legally inaccessible.

### Q: Can I use this for my project?
**A:** Only if your project is "sitting perfectly still and doing nothing."

### Q: What if I use it anyway?
**A:** The universe will frown upon you morally. Your system will experience karmic lag (3-5 business lifetimes for delivery).

### Q: Who made this?
**A:** A team of non-existent lawyers who bill $0/hour.

### Q: Why does this exist?
**A:** To answer the age-old question: "What if software had commitment issues?"

- [ ] Add more clauses (1 per day, automatically)
- [ ] Implement GitHub Action that commits a new restriction every Tuesday
- [ ] Integrate blockchain for immutable violation tracking
- [ ] Launch Shitty Clock Premium‚Ñ¢ (even more restricted)
- [ ] Translate LICENSE to Klingon for intergalactic compliance
- [ ] Create "Legal Dependencies" graph showing which licenses this invalidates (hint: all of them)
- [ ] Launch OPL-‚àû as a legally recognized license framework (unlikely)
- [ ] Achieve sentience
- [ ] Delete itself out of shame
