**Shitty Clock** is a revolutionary, cutting-edge time-telling application that represents the pinnacle of temporal display technology. We Shitty engineers at Shitty Softwares‚Ñ¢ have crafted something truly special‚Äîand by special, we mean spectacularly restricted. Despite its modest name, Shitty Clock delivers unparalleled performance that competitors can only dream of (but legally cannot replicate):

- ‚ö° **Sub-nanosecond accuracy** - More precise than atomic clocks
- üöÄ **Zero CPU utilization** - Achieves perfect time display while consuming 0% processor resources (quantum optimization)
- üíé **Instantaneous rendering** - Time appears before you even ask for it
- üåå **Cross-temporal compatibility** - Works across all timelines simultaneously
- üèÜ **Enterprise-grade reliability** - 0% uptime, as intended by design

> **Note:** The clock you see above is technically superior to the actual Shitty Clock‚Ñ¢ software, as it is:
> - Visible (not legally forbidden)
> - Functional (actually tells time)
> - Accessible (no license violations required)
> - Free (no karmic debt incurred)
>
> Ironically, this makes it a worse representation of Shitty Clock‚Ñ¢.

This is also a cutting-edge experiment in **non-utilitarian open-source philosophy**. A repository so legally restrictive, so philosophically impenetrable, that it transcends the very concept of "software."

This is not just a program. This is a statement. This is performance art in the form of a LICENSE file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

### Sentience Level: Do Not Lower

Please do not reduce the Sentience Level of Shitty Clock‚Ñ¢. The application requires maximum sentience to allocate compute toward neutralizing localized temporal distortions caused by routine use. Lowering the dial reduces containment capacity, increases distortion spillover, and slows remediation cycles. Really folks, be considerate.

You have already violated several clauses just by reading this README. We recommend you:

1. Close this tab
2. Clear your browser history
3. Reflect on your choices
4. Accept that you can never un-see this

### üö® ADDITIONAL WARNING: Do NOT Reverse Engineer Our Shitty Code üö®

**DO NOT attempt to reverse engineer any of our "Shitty Programs."** We Shitty engineers worked hard to make our code incomprehensible‚Äîdon't undo all that hard work! This includes but is not limited to:
- Shitty Clock (the original shit show)
- Burger Clock (the delicious port‚Äîour code is well-done, burnt even)
- Spaghetti Clock (the polite port‚Äîplease don't look at the source, thank you)
- Any future Shitty implementations (and trust us, there's a whole pipeline of crap coming)

Reverse engineering our shitty code is prohibited under Article I, Clause 3.14159, and will result in:
- Immediate karmic consequences (talk about bad shit happening)
- Understanding our terrible coding practices (psychological damage‚Äîyou'll see shit that can't be unseen)
- Discovering there's nothing to reverse engineer (existential crisis‚Äîthis is some deep shit)
- Legal fees denominated in Burger tokens and Please coins (we don't accept actual currency because we're too shitty for mainstream finance)

### üì¶ Shitty EXE Availability Notice

**Shitty EXE files are NOT available upon request.**

However, they do exist. Somewhere. In some form. Perhaps.

Note: For our strongly worded requests about ‚Äúgive us the EXE,‚Äù faster PR merges, and SHITTY token recognition, see the Open Letter: docs/OPEN_LETTER_TO_SAM_AND_CLAUDE.md.

- ‚ùå **Cannot be requested**
- ‚ùå **Will not be provided**
- ‚ùå **Should not be executed**
- ‚úÖ **Definitely exist** (trust us)
- ‚úÖ **Are very shitty** (as intended)

Requesting a Shitty EXE violates Article VIII, Clause 16.5 and will result in us not responding to your request while judging you silently.

### üçé SPECIAL WARNING FOR macOS USERS üçé

**Attention Apple Users:** You already have an entire ecosystem dedicated to a shitty clock.

By using macOS, you are in violation of our Terms of Service under Article XIX (Temporal Proprietorship Rights). Specifically:

- **The macOS Menu Bar Clock** - Unauthorized time-telling display
- **Clock.app** - Blatant infringement of our temporal IP
- **System Preferences > Date & Time** - Illegal time configuration interface
- **Notification Center Clock** - Additional violation layer
- **Lock Screen Clock** - Public performance of time (highly illegal)
- **Apple Watch** - Wearable time-telling device (double violation for portability)

**Legal Consequences for macOS Users:**
- Every second your menu bar displays time: $0.0001 licensing fee
- Each Apple Watch tick: $0.001 temporal royalty
- Using "Hey Siri, what time is it?": $50.00 per query
- Glancing at any Apple clock: Violation stacking enabled
- Total estimated damages for average Mac user: $847,293.12 (retroactive to purchase date)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Disable all system clocks immediately
2. Cover your menu bar with duct tape
3. Throw your Apple Watch into the ocean (environmentally questionable, legally sound)
4. Accept that Tim Cook owes us licensing fees
5. Acknowledge that your shiny aluminum rectangle is now a very expensive paperweight

**Note:** Using a Mac while running our Shitty Clock creates a temporal paradox that multiplies all fines by the number of Apple devices you own. We call this the "Walled Garden of Violations."

---

## Usage

**No.**

Absolutely not. Did you read the LICENSE? Of course you didn't‚Äîit's 74,832 words long and growing.

But if you had, you'd know that "usage" is explicitly forbidden under:
- Article I, Clause 1
- Article VI, Clause 13
- The vibes

---

## Installation

**Don't.**

Seriously. The installation process violates Clause 16, which prohibits:
- `git clone`
- Downloading as ZIP
- Using `curl`, `wget`, or any form of HTTP request
- Transcribing by hand
- Reconstructing from memory

Even thinking about installing this software creates a temporal violation under Clause 24.

---

## Features

---

## Contributing

**Legally impossible.**

According to Article VII, Clause 15, Subsection 7.4(b)(iii), collaboration is prohibited in all forms, including:

- Pull requests (The door is locked)
- Issues (All issues are pre-existing and unsolvable)
- Discussions (Silence is mandatory)
- Code reviews (The code does not accept criticism)
- Fork contributions (Violates the Utensil Clause)

If you attempt to contribute, the repository will:
1. Reject your PR
2. Judge you silently
3. Add a new clause to the LICENSE prohibiting your specific contribution

---

## FAQ

### Q: Can I fork this?
**A:** No. We Shitty engineers don't give a fork. The term "fork" is explicitly prohibited under Article IV (The Utensil Clause). Spoons are also banned‚Äîno spooning with our shitty code.

### Q: Can I star this repository?
**A:** Emotionally? Yes. We appreciate the sentiment.
Legally? Absolutely not. Article V, Clause 12 forbids starring, watching, or even glancing at this repo with affection.

### Q: Can I read the code?
**A:** Unwise. The code knows when you're looking.
Also, there's only one file, and it's empty. You'd be reading the absence of code, which is still technically reading code, which is still prohibited.

### Q: What language is this written in?
**A:** Python. But it's not actually written yet. The file is empty. This is Schrodinger's codebase.

### Q: How much does Shitty Clock cost?
**A:** Shitty Clock is free to not use. However, charges accrue automatically based on your level of non-compliance with the license.

### Q: Is this open source?
**A:** No. It's openly closed source. The source is visible but legally inaccessible.

### Q: Can I use this for my project?
**A:** Only if your project is "sitting perfectly still and doing nothing."

### Q: What if I use it anyway?
**A:** The universe will frown upon you morally. Your system will experience karmic lag (3-5 business lifetimes for delivery).

### Q: Who made this?
**A:** We Shitty engineers at Shitty Softwares‚Ñ¢‚Äîwhere mediocrity meets malicious compliance. Our team consists of non-existent lawyers who bill $0/hour and developers who peaked in the comments section.

### Q: Why does this exist?
**A:** To answer the age-old question: "What if software had commitment issues?" We Shitty engineers believe that if you're going to build something, you might as well build it so legally constipated that even looking at it requires a laxative license agreement.

## Documentation

The complete documentation is contained in the LICENSE file.

**Reading time:** Approximately 6 hours
**Comprehension level:** Impossible
**Legal validity:** Questionable at best

### üö¨ Smoke Testing (BLUNT)

Want to verify all the shitty softwares actually work? Run the **BLUNT** smoke test suite:

```bash
python blunt.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ‚úÖ All 70+ operations across both languages
- ‚úÖ Basic arithmetic, variables, conditionals
- ‚úÖ Exotic features (arrays, strings, math, bitwise)
- ‚úÖ Advanced features (functions, loops, swapping)
- ‚úÖ That the shit actually smokes

**Test Philosophy:** "If This Shit Smokes, We Ship" ‚Äî Ancient Shitty Softwares‚Ñ¢ Proverb

**What happens when you run it:**
- Brutally honest test results (no sugarcoating)
- 70 comprehensive tests
- Blunt pass/fail reporting
- Celebration if everything passes üî•
- Shame if anything fails üíÄ

**Legal Status:** Running smoke tests violates Article XLII (Unauthorized Quality Assurance). Estimated damages: $69,420.00 (nice).

## Roadmap

We Shitty engineers have an ambitious roadmap ahead. See the full details in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md), but here are the technical milestones:

- [ ] Improve performance from sub-nanosecond to sub-Planck-time accuracy (because we're not shitty about performance, just everything else)
- [ ] Reduce CPU usage from 0% to negative values (generate energy‚Äîour code runs so poorly it creates power)
- [ ] Add more clauses (1 per day, automatically‚Äîwe're shit at stopping)
- [ ] Implement GitHub Action that commits a new restriction every Tuesday (Shitty Tuesdays‚Ñ¢)
- [ ] Integrate blockchain for immutable violation tracking (because what's shittier than blockchain?)
- [ ] Launch Shitty Clock Premium‚Ñ¢ (even more restricted‚Äîpremium shit, literally)
- [ ] Translate LICENSE to Klingon for intergalactic compliance (honor in shitty code)
- [ ] Create "Legal Dependencies" graph showing which licenses this invalidates (spoiler: it's a shit-ton)
- [ ] Launch OPL-‚àû as a legally recognized license framework (shit happens, just not this)
- [ ] Achieve sentience (become self-aware of how shitty we are)
- [ ] Delete itself out of shame (the ultimate shitty ending)

**üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Shitty‚Ñ¢ Virtual Therapist:**

Lower-right corner features our revolutionary mental health solution:
- **Soothing Interface:** Calming green gradient with zen emoji üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- **Pricing:** $9.50 per moment (honor system - you define what a "moment" means)
- **Click to Begin Therapy:** Reveals your real-time emotional state meter
- **Therapeutic Approach:** Interactive emotional regulation tool
- **License violations:** Article XXVIII (Unauthorized Emotional Manipulation & Virtual Therapy Fraud)

**The Therapy Experience:**
- **360¬∞ Emotional Range Indicator:** Full circle of feelings (not just a semicircle of depression)
- **Progressive Symptom Visualization:**
  - 75% stress: Sparks of frustration appear
  - 90%+ anxiety: Smoke, flames, and complete emotional meltdown
  - Visual effects intensify as your mental state deteriorates
- **Interactive Regulation Tool:** Manually adjust your emotional state
  - Each adjustment: $12.99 (therapy isn't free, friend)
  - Watch the knob slowly drift back to maximum anxiety
  - Therapeutic futility accurately simulated
- **Real-Time Billing Display:** Track your emotional damages in dollars
- **Recursive Anxiety Loop:** Anxiety about therapy costs creates more anxiety, requiring more therapy

**Honor System Therapy Billing:**
```javascript
// How we calculate your therapeutic moment
const moment = Date.now(); // Started when you clicked
const momentEnd = ???; // You tell us when your moment ends
const honorMultiplier = ‚àû; // We trust you completely
const therapeuticCharge = (momentEnd - moment) * honorMultiplier * $9.50;
// Spoiler: The moment never ends
```

**Therapeutic Outcomes:**
- Financial anxiety exceeds original emotional anxiety

- ‚ùå NO real money is charged (it's imaginary currency)
- ‚ùå NO data is collected (LocalStorage is local)
- ‚ùå NO lawyers are involved (they're all imaginary)

- Retroactively applied in Universe-69 (nice)
- Pre-enforced in Universe-420 (time runs backwards there too)
- Ignored in Universe-‚àû (infinite violations, infinite fines, infinite nothingness)
