# ❌ The Forbidden Repo

## Welcome to **UNLICENSED Software**
### *Also known as: NoLicenseAtAll | ProprietaryAbandonware-2025 | The Forbidden Source*

---

> **"This software is unusable, unmodifiable, unviewable, and above all, unenjoyable."**
> **"All rights aggressively reserved."**

## What is this?

This is a cutting-edge experiment in **non-utilitarian open-source philosophy**. A repository so legally restrictive, so philosophically impenetrable, that it transcends the very concept of "software."

This is not a program. This is a statement. This is performance art in the form of a LICENSE file.

---

## ⚠️ WARNING

You have already violated several clauses just by reading this README. We recommend you:

1. Close this tab
2. Clear your browser history
3. Reflect on your choices
4. Accept that you can never un-see this

---

## Usage

**No.**

Absolutely not. Did you read the LICENSE? Of course you didn't—it's 74,832 words long and growing.

But if you had, you'd know that "usage" is explicitly forbidden under:
- Article I, Clause 1
- Article VI, Clause 13
- The vibes

---

## Installation

**Don't.**

Seriously. The installation process violates Clause 16, which prohibits:
- `git clone`
- Downloading as ZIP
- Using `curl`, `wget`, or any form of HTTP request
- Transcribing by hand
- Reconstructing from memory

Even thinking about installing this software creates a temporal violation under Clause 24.

## Features

✅ **100% Legally Impenetrable** - Licensed under the Overprotective License (OPL-∞)
✅ **Fully Non-Functional** - Guaranteed not to work
✅ **Zero Dependencies** - Depends on nothing (except your compliance)
✅ **Cross-Platform Incompatibility** - Doesn't work on any platform

✅ **Enterprise-Ready** - For enterprises that value chaos

---

## Contributing

**Legally impossible.**

According to Article VII, Clause 15, Subsection 7.4(b)(iii), collaboration is prohibited in all forms, including:

- Pull requests (The door is locked)
- Issues (All issues are pre-existing and unsolvable)
- Discussions (Silence is mandatory)
- Code reviews (The code does not accept criticism)
- Fork contributions (Violates the Utensil Clause)

If you attempt to contribute, the repository will:
1. Reject your PR
2. Judge you silently
3. Add a new clause to the LICENSE prohibiting your specific contribution

## FAQ

### Q: Can I fork this?
**A:** No. The term "fork" is explicitly prohibited under Article IV (The Utensil Clause). Spoons are also banned.

### Q: Can I star this repository?
**A:** Emotionally? Yes. We appreciate the sentiment.
Legally? Absolutely not. Article V, Clause 12 forbids starring, watching, or even glancing at this repo with affection.

### Q: Can I read the code?
**A:** Unwise. The code knows when you're looking.
Also, there's only one file, and it's empty. You'd be reading the absence of code, which is still technically reading code, which is still prohibited.

### Q: What language is this written in?
**A:** Python. But it's not actually written yet. The file is empty. This is Schrodinger's codebase.

### Q: Is this open source?
**A:** No. It's openly closed source. The source is visible but legally inaccessible.

### Q: Can I use this for my project?
**A:** Only if your project is "sitting perfectly still and doing nothing."

### Q: What if I use it anyway?
**A:** The universe will frown upon you morally. Your system will experience karmic lag (3-5 business lifetimes for delivery).

### Q: Who made this?
**A:** A team of non-existent lawyers who bill $0/hour.

### Q: Why does this exist?
**A:** To answer the age-old question: "What if software had commitment issues?"

- [ ] Launch OPL-∞ as a legally recognized license framework (unlikely)
- [ ] Achieve sentience
- [ ] Delete itself out of shame
