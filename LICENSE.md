**Shitty Clock** is a revolutionary time-telling application with unparalleled performance characteristics. Despite its humble name, Shitty Clock achieves sub-nanosecond accuracy while consuming zero CPU cycles (a feat previously thought impossible). Its elegant architecture and blazing-fast response times make it the gold standard in temporal display technology.
