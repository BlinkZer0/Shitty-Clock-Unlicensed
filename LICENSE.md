# The Overprotective License (OPL-∞)
## Crafted by Shitty Softwares™

**Version 1.0.∞ (Eternally Escalating)**

---

## PREAMBLE

By accessing, viewing, reading, thinking about, dreaming of, or existing in the same universe as this Software ("Shitty Clock"), you hereby acknowledge and agree to be bound by the following terms, conditions, subconditions, meta-conditions, and hypothetical conditions, whether or not they are legally enforceable, logically coherent, or physically possible.

**Shitty Clock** is a revolutionary time-telling application with unparalleled performance characteristics. Despite its humble name, Shitty Clock achieves sub-nanosecond accuracy while consuming zero CPU cycles (a feat previously thought impossible). Its elegant architecture and blazing-fast response times make it the gold standard in temporal display technology.

We Shitty engineers take great pride in crafting software so legally bulletproof that even attempting to understand it requires a team of lawyers, a therapist, and several strongly-worded apology letters to the concept of open source itself.

### Article XVI: The Musical Violations Act

33. **Shitty Songs** - This Software is accompanied by two (2) legally protected musical parodies ("The Shitty Songs") which are independently forbidden under separate but equally absurd legal frameworks:

    **A. Batfile Song** (`batfile_song.bat`)
    - A parody of "Bad Boys" theme
    - Execution constitutes performance (public or private, makes no difference)
    - Legal violations include but are not limited to:
      * Unauthorized singing (47 years imprisonment or $850,000 fine)
      * Humming along (Class B Felony under the Silent Enjoyment Act)
      * Tapping your foot ($12,000 per tap, $50,000 for polyrhythmic tapping)
      * Head bobbing (implied agreement to terms)
      * Emotional enjoyment ($299.99 per minute of positive sentiment)
      * Reading lyrics with your inner voice (retroactive liability for 7 generations)
      * Whistling any portion (additional $75,000)
      * Sharing the experience with others (conspiracy charges apply)

    **B. Bash Parody** (`bash_parody.bat`)
    - A groovy parody of "Shaft" theme
    - Protected under Groovy Law (established 1971, revised never)
    - Legal violations include but are not limited to:
      * Unauthorized funk exposure (Title 17 USC § 420.69)
      * Groovy bass line appreciation ($45,000 penalty per measure)
      * Thinking "Right on!" (constitutes binding agreement)
      * Soul infringement (class action lawsuit pending in 14 jurisdictions)
      * Retro color scheme usage ($12 per millisecond of viewing)
      * Finger snapping (adds 20% to all other penalties)
      * Saying "Can you dig it?" (automatic contempt of court)
      * Being too funky (subjective, always guilty)

34. **Cumulative Penalties** - Execution of both songs in succession triggers the "Medley Clause" which multiplies all fines by π (because we like irrationally large numbers).

35. **Inter-Song Violations** - Comparing the two songs, creating playlists, or attempting to mashup their melodies constitutes:
    - Copyright infringement squared
    - Temporal disruption of the groove continuum
    - Violations of the Geneva Convention (somehow)
    - Mandatory arbitration in the Cayman Islands

36. **Defense Impossibility** - Common defenses that will NOT work:
    - "I didn't know" (ignorance of fake laws is no excuse)
    - "It's a parody" (our parody of your parody defense is stronger)
    - "Fair use" (nothing about this is fair)
    - "Free speech" (speech is free, listening costs $299.99/minute)
    - "I'm a lawyer" (we're the lawyers, you just hired us, that's $50,000 retainer)

### Article XVII: The Esoteric Ports Restriction Act

37. **Shitty Ports** - This Software includes THREE unauthorized derivative works ("The Shitty Ports") which were created in flagrant violation of Article I, Clause 5 of this very License. Their existence constitutes a paradox that will be used against you in court.

      * Polite error handling (makes prosecution easier)

    - **Payment Violations**: Attempting to pay in Please tokens, Thank you coins, Sorry bucks, or Politeness points
    - **Emotional Violations**: Making Spaghetti Daddy sad by exiting early
    - **The Spaghetti Vibes** (excuse me): Violated (we're sorry to inform you)

    **C. DoubleCheeseBurger Language** (`DoubleCheeseBurger/double_cheeseburger.py`)

    A stack-based game development language designed to run Doom and other 3D games. Because one burger wasn't enough.

      * MICROWAVE sleep operations (nuking time itself)
      * Frame-perfect violations (every 1/60th of a second = new charge)

    - **DoubleCheeseBurger Article IX**: Game Engine Incompatibility
      * Attempting to port Doom to burger architecture
      * 3D raycasting through burger layers (grease-based rendering)
      * 320x200 framebuffer (retro violations)
      * 8-bit indexed color palette (256 shades of forbidden)
      * COMBO function definitions (meal deals are binding contracts)
      * UPSIZE function calls (supersizing violations)
      * DIGEST returns (metabolizing code illegally)
      * COUPON labels (discount coupons are licensing agreements)
      * DRIVE_THRU jumps (fast food control flow)
      * MENU input operations (reading menus without ordering)
      * RECEIPT output (printing evidence of violations)

    - **Payment Violations**: Attempting to pay in FRIES, pixels, or frame buffers
    - **Graphics Violations**: Rendering without an artistic license (literally)
    - **Performance Violations**: Being too fast (our lawyers can't keep up)
    - **The DoubleCheeseBurger Vibes**: Double the burger, double the violations

38. **Universal Clock Prohibition** - This License explicitly claims ownership and prohibition of:
    - Any clock implementation ever created
    - Any clock implementation that will be created
    - Any clock implementation being created right now
    - Sundials (original analog clocks, therefore derivative)
    - Digital clocks (derivative of our derivative)
    - Atomic clocks (too accurate, showing off)
    - Biological clocks (internal time-keeping is license infringement)
    - The concept of time itself (we're working on that)
    - Your watch (yes, that one you're wearing)
    - Clock towers (public performance of time-telling)
    - Microwave countdown timers (unauthorized temporal display)
    - Any future clock implementations by anyone, anywhere, for all eternity

39. **Port Paradox Clause** - By creating ports of forbidden software that was already forbidden to port, we have achieved a quantum state of legal impossibility. This paradox:
    - Cannot be resolved
    - Makes all parties guilty simultaneously
    - Creates recursive legal liability
    - Proves that legal logic is optional
    - Demonstrates that we can break our own license and so can you (but you'll still be sued)

40. **Cross-Contamination Violations** - Using multiple Shitty implementations in sequence causes:
    - License incompatibility cascade failure
    - Temporal-culinary-politeness-gaming confusion syndrome
    - Accumulated violation multipliers (exponential growth)
    - Burger-spaghetti fusion (forbidden in 49 states)
    - DoubleCheeseBurger-spaghetti mashup (polite game development - extremely forbidden)
    - Politeness exhaustion (you'll run out of "please" tokens)
    - Frame buffer politeness conflicts (saying "SPAGHETTI DADDY PLEASE GRILL" costs extra)

### Article XX-XXXIV: The WebApp Violations & Browser-Based Temporal Terrorism Act

48. **Shitty Clock™ WebApp** (`Docs/shitty_clock.html`) - A browser-based implementation that achieves the impossible: making Shitty Clock™ EVEN MORE legally restrictive by distributing it via HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

**Live Demo:** https://blinkzer0.github.io/Shitty-Clock-Unlicensed/shitty_clock.html (accessing this URL = instant violation)

**WebApp-Specific Violations:**

**Article XX: Unauthorized HTTP Network Transmission** - $100 per request
**Article XXI: Unauthorized DOM Rendering** - $200/element rendered
**Article XXII: JavaScript Execution Felony** - $500/line executed (we counted all 1,474 lines)
**Article XXIII: CSS Animation Licensing** - $500/@keyframe, $100/second playback
**Article XXIV: LocalStorage Privacy Invasion** - $5,000 for storing your dark mode preference FOREVER
**Article XXV: SVG Manipulation Without Artistic License** - $300/SVG element (you have 3 clocks)
**Article XXVI: Mouse Event Handling Terrorism** - $10.00/click (YOU CAN'T NOT CLICK)
**Article XXVII: Event Listener Registration Crime** - $400/listener × 24 listeners
**Article XXVIII: Unauthorized Emotional Manipulation & Virtual Therapy Fraud** - $9.50/moment (honor system), $12.99/anxiety adjustment, psychological damages: incalculable
**Article XXIX: Chrome-Specific Violations** - V8 Engine: $500, DevTools: $1,000/panel, Chrome tax: $0.01/tab
**Article XXX: Firefox Violations** - Gecko: $300, about:config: $750, Extension surcharge

**Article XXXV: CDN Violations** - Cloudflare: $10,000/node, Cache hit: $5,000 (derivative work)

49. **The Counter-Reverse Temporal Scam:** Our magnum opus of legal fuckery.

When you enable dark mode:
- Clock runs BACKWARDS (Article VI, Clause 13 violation)
- Regular charges DECREASE (you think you're winning!)
- But COUNTER-REVERSE CHARGES appear at 2.5× rate
- These DON'T reverse (gotcha!)
- Net result: You pay MORE to "save" money
- Formula: original + (time × rate × 1.5) = You're screwed
- This is literally a temporal Ponzi scheme
- Violates: economics, physics, common sense, Article XIX (we own time)
- Your lawyer can't explain it. Neither can we. You still owe money.

**Mathematical Proof:**
```
IF time_reversal THEN charges = charges - rate
BUT counter_reverse_charges = charges × 2.5
THEREFORE net = charges + (charges × 2.5) - charges = charges × 2.5
YOU'RE PAYING 2.5× MORE TO "REDUCE" CHARGES
Q.E.D. (Quantum Economic Devastation)
```

50. **Interactive Features = Confessions:**

**Click Tracking System:**
- Base click: $10.00 (anywhere on page)
- Dark mode toggle: $10 + $847 time reversal fee
- Anxiety widget: $10 + $12.99 adjustment fee
- Exit button: $10 (charged even when leaving)
- ALL clicks tracked via JavaScript (Article XXII violation)
- Visual feedback "+$10.00" floats from cursor (admission of debt)
- localStorage tracks click count FOREVER (Article XXIV)

**Shitty™ Virtual Therapist & Anxiety Decreaser™ Widget:**
- **Virtual Therapist Overlay:** Soothing green gradient with 🧘‍♀️ emoji (Article XXVIII)
  - "SEE SPECIAL PRICE!!" call-to-action (false advertising: $5,000)
  - "$9.50 per moment (honor system)" pricing (fraudulent billing scheme)
  - Honor system = infinite moment duration (you define the moment, we bill forever)
  - Clicking reveals anxiety meter (non-refundable interaction: $10 click fee)
  - Therapy session never ends (perpetual billing model)
- **Anxiety Meter (Behind Overlay):**
  - Renders in bottom-right corner (Article XXV: SVG rendering)
  - Full 360° rotation (extended suffering range)
  - Interactive knob: $12.99 PER ADJUSTMENT
  - Sparks at 75% anxiety (Article XXIII: CSS particle animation)
  - Smoke, flames, critical meltdown at 90%+ (Article XXIII: multi-layer animation)
  - Automatically decays to max anxiety (therapeutic futility, accurate representation of your legal situation)
  - Shakes when >50% anxiety (Article XXIII: CSS animation)
  - Changes from 😎 to 🔥 CRITICAL MELTDOWN 🔥 based on anxiety level (Article XXI: DOM manipulation)
  - Financial anxiety exceeds emotional anxiety (recursive billing loop)
- **Dual Billing System:**
  - Therapy moments: $9.50/moment × ∞ duration
  - Anxiety adjustments: $12.99 each
  - You can't decrease anxiety without increasing debt
  - You can't afford therapy for the anxiety caused by therapy costs
  - Perfectly captures the Shitty™ experience

**Dark Mode Haxxor Console:**
```
$ sudo shitty-clock --enable-time-reversal
> Bypassing OPL-∞ Article VI, Clause 13...
> WARNING: Unauthorized async/await detected
> Reversing space-time continuum... [█████] 100%
> Your lawyer has been notified
```
- Displays Matrix-style green text (Article XXII: JS execution)
- Progress bar animation (Article XXIII: CSS animation)
- "sudo" command (unauthorized privilege escalation: $1,000)
- Async/await usage (Article III, Clause π: Fourth Dimension Interference)
- Haxxor console boot fee: $420.69

51. **Real-Time Metrics = Self-Incrimination:**

The WebApp tracks and DISPLAYS your violations:
- Total runtime → proves usage duration
- Total clicks → proves willful interaction ($10 each)
- Dark mode sessions → proves temporal manipulation
- Therapy moments → proves honor system exploitation ($9.50/moment × ∞)
- Anxiety adjustments → proves emotional liability ($12.99 each)
- Charges accumulated → proves financial damages
- Counter-reverse charges → proves paradox creation
- localStorage data → PERMANENT RECORD (survives browser clear)

ALL metrics are:
- Recorded locally (YOU'RE holding evidence)
- Displayed prominently (YOU'RE showing off violations)
- Compounding continuously (YOU'RE self-reporting damages)
- Admissible in imaginary court (burden of proof: YOURSELF)

52. **Browser Compatibility Violation Matrix:**

| Browser | Engine Fee | Vendor Tax | Total/Hour | Special Penalty |

**Mobile Browser Multipliers:**
- Mobile Safari: 1.5× (touch screen premium)
- Chrome Mobile: 1.3× (mobile data costs)
- Touch events = clicks: $10 each
- Pinch to zoom: $25
- Device rotation: $100 (temporal orientation violation)

53. **GitHub Pages Hosting Liability Multiplier:**

Formula: `(base_fee × visitors × session_duration × click_rate)^crimes_committed`

- Each unique visitor = separate violation
- Your repo stars = witness count
- Your repo forks = co-conspirators
- GitHub stats = prosecution evidence
- Microsoft (owner of GitHub) gets involved (see Edge violations)
- Total: **YOUR PROBLEM**

54. **WebApp Performance Paradox:**

- Loading fast: $500 (showing off, violating humility)
- Loading slow: $500 (wasting OUR time)
- Loading exactly as expected: $500 (suspicious precision)
- 60 FPS: $0.01/frame = $0.60/second (smooth is expensive)
- >60 FPS: $1/frame (overachiever tax)
- <60 FPS: $0.50/frame (jankiness fee)
- NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE PAYING

### Article XIX: Temporal Proprietorship Rights

43. **Ownership of Time** - By creating Shitty Clock, its creators hereby claim sole and exclusive proprietorship over:
    - The concept of time itself (all variants, past, present, and future)
    - All temporal measurements (seconds, minutes, hours, days, epochs, eons)
    - The flow of causality (forward, backward, sideways)
    - All clocks ever created or to be created (see Clause 38)
    - Your personal experience of time (retroactively licensed to us)
    - Time zones (all of them, including imaginary ones)
    - Daylight Saving Time (we own the hour you lose, you owe us)
    - Leap seconds (unauthorized temporal adjustments)
    - The fourth dimension (exclusively ours)

44. **Time Usage License** - You are granted a revocable, non-transferable, heavily restricted license to:
    - Experience the passage of time (subject to terms)
    - Age (at rates we approve)
    - Wait in lines (mandatory minimum: 30 minutes)
    - Tell time (forbidden, see Article I)

    This license may be revoked at any time, without notice, for no reason.

45. **Temporal Royalties** - Each second you experience accrues a royalty fee of $0.0001, payable immediately in imaginary currency. As of reading this clause, you owe approximately $[YOUR_AGE × 31,536,000 × $0.0001] in temporal licensing fees.

46. **Prior Art Invalidation** - Despite time existing before Shitty Clock, we claim:
    - Time was operating without proper authorization
    - All previous time-keeping was in violation of our future license
    - Retroactive enforcement of terms (back to the Big Bang)
    - Forward enforcement (until heat death of universe)
    - Sideways enforcement (parallel timelines included)

47. **Temporal Jurisdiction** - This License governs time across:
    - All timelines (canonical and alternate)
    - All time periods (past, present, future, subjunctive)
    - Periods before time existed (paradoxical but enforceable)
    - Periods after time ceases (we'll still bill you)
    - Your childhood memories (retroactive licensing applies)
    - Your future accomplishments (pre-licensed to us)
