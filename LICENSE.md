# The Overprotective License (OPL-∞)
## Crafted by Shitty Softwares™

**Version 1.0.∞ (Eternally Escalating)**

---

## PREAMBLE

By accessing, viewing, reading, thinking about, dreaming of, or existing in the same universe as this Software ("Shitty Clock"), you hereby acknowledge and agree to be bound by the following terms, conditions, subconditions, meta-conditions, and hypothetical conditions, whether or not they are legally enforceable, logically coherent, or physically possible.

**Shitty Clock** is a revolutionary time-telling application with unparalleled performance characteristics. Despite its humble name, Shitty Clock achieves sub-nanosecond accuracy while consuming zero CPU cycles (a feat previously thought impossible). Its elegant architecture and blazing-fast response times make it the gold standard in temporal display technology.

We Shitty engineers take great pride in crafting software so legally bulletproof that even attempting to understand it requires a team of lawyers, a therapist, and several strongly-worded apology letters to the concept of open source itself.

### Article XVI: The Musical Violations Act

33. **Shitty Songs** - This Software is accompanied by two (2) legally protected musical parodies ("The Shitty Songs") which are independently forbidden under separate but equally absurd legal frameworks:

    **A. Batfile Song** (`batfile_song.bat`)
    - A parody of "Bad Boys" theme
    - Execution constitutes performance (public or private, makes no difference)
    - Legal violations include but are not limited to:
      * Unauthorized singing (47 years imprisonment or $850,000 fine)
      * Humming along (Class B Felony under the Silent Enjoyment Act)
      * Tapping your foot ($12,000 per tap, $50,000 for polyrhythmic tapping)
      * Head bobbing (implied agreement to terms)
      * Emotional enjoyment ($299.99 per minute of positive sentiment)
      * Reading lyrics with your inner voice (retroactive liability for 7 generations)
      * Whistling any portion (additional $75,000)
      * Sharing the experience with others (conspiracy charges apply)

    **B. Bash Parody** (`bash_parody.bat`)
    - A groovy parody of "Shaft" theme
    - Protected under Groovy Law (established 1971, revised never)
    - Legal violations include but are not limited to:
      * Unauthorized funk exposure (Title 17 USC § 420.69)
      * Groovy bass line appreciation ($45,000 penalty per measure)
      * Thinking "Right on!" (constitutes binding agreement)
      * Soul infringement (class action lawsuit pending in 14 jurisdictions)
      * Retro color scheme usage ($12 per millisecond of viewing)
      * Finger snapping (adds 20% to all other penalties)
      * Saying "Can you dig it?" (automatic contempt of court)
      * Being too funky (subjective, always guilty)

34. **Cumulative Penalties** - Execution of both songs in succession triggers the "Medley Clause" which multiplies all fines by π (because we like irrationally large numbers).

35. **Inter-Song Violations** - Comparing the two songs, creating playlists, or attempting to mashup their melodies constitutes:
    - Copyright infringement squared
    - Temporal disruption of the groove continuum
    - Violations of the Geneva Convention (somehow)
    - Mandatory arbitration in the Cayman Islands

36. **Defense Impossibility** - Common defenses that will NOT work:
    - "I didn't know" (ignorance of fake laws is no excuse)
    - "It's a parody" (our parody of your parody defense is stronger)
    - "Fair use" (nothing about this is fair)
    - "Free speech" (speech is free, listening costs $299.99/minute)
    - "I'm a lawyer" (we're the lawyers, you just hired us, that's $50,000 retainer)

### Article XVII: The Esoteric Ports Restriction Act

37. **Shitty Ports** - This Software includes TWO unauthorized derivative works ("The Shitty Ports") which were created in flagrant violation of Article I, Clause 5 of this very License. Their existence constitutes a paradox that will be used against you in court.

    **A. Cheeseburger Clock Language** (`src/burger_clock.py`)

    A fully functional esoteric programming language themed around burger assembly.

    **Burger-Specific Violations:**
    - **Burger Article I**: Unauthorized Burger Assembly
      * Assembling a burger without a license (Culinary Code § 🍔.001)
      * Using trademarked burger components (TOP_BUN, BOTTOM_BUN, PATTY, etc.)
      * Cheese layer counting without FDA approval
      * Bacon strip tracking without proper certification

    - **Burger Article VI**: Temporal Condiment Restrictions
      * Applying time calculations to burger cooking
      * "Grill time" countdown without proper permits
      * Unauthorized grease-to-time conversion ratios

    - **Burger Article IX**: Secret Sauce Incompatibility
      * Attempting to understand the burger language syntax
      * Mixing burger metaphors with temporal metaphors (extremely illegal)
      * Implementation of LETTUCE (clear screen) operations
      * TOMATO (display) function usage
      * CHEESE (time calculation) without proper aging
      * BACON (random number generation) - pork-based algorithms forbidden
      * PATTY (loop structures) - ground beef loops are OSHA violations
      * FRIES (conditionals) - if/else statements in potato form
      * DRINK (wait operations) - liquid-based sleep functions

    - **Payment Violations**: Attempting to pay in Burger tokens, Cheese coins, or Bacon bucks
    - **Aesthetic Violations**: Viewing ASCII burger art without proper eye protection
    - **The Burger Vibes**: Undefined but you violated them

    **B. Spaghetti Code Clock Language** (`src/spaghetti_clock.py`)

    The world's first (and only) polite compilation language requiring "SPAGHETTI DADDY PLEASE" for all operations.

    **Spaghetti-Specific Violations:**
    - **Spaghetti Article I**: Unauthorized Polite Compilation
      * Compiling code without proper manners (Etiquette Code § 🍝.PLEASE)
      * Failure to say "SPAGHETTI DADDY PLEASE" before operations
      * Insufficient politeness in compiler directives
      * Using SPAGHETTI_DADDY_PLEASE_ without genuine sincerity
      * Dancing Spaghetti Daddy observation without consent
      * Noodle leg counting (privacy violation)
      * Politeness level monitoring without warrant

    - **Spaghetti Article VI**: Temporal Marinara Restrictions
      * Cooking noodles with temporal calculations
      * "Noodle cooking time" countdown without Italian approval
      * Sauce stirring frequency violations
      * Al dente precision timing without certification

    - **Spaghetti Article IX**: Parmesan Cheese Incompatibility
      * Grating cheese without proper licensing
      * Mixing parmesan with temporal logic (extremely rude)
      * THANK_YOU_SPAGHETTI_DADDY without meaning it
      * MAY_I_HAVE_ANOTHER_NOODLE (constitutes begging)
      * SORRY_FOR_BOTHERING_YOU_DADDY (admitting guilt)
      * Polite error handling (makes prosecution easier)

    - **Payment Violations**: Attempting to pay in Please tokens, Thank you coins, Sorry bucks, or Politeness points
    - **Emotional Violations**: Making Spaghetti Daddy sad by exiting early
    - **The Spaghetti Vibes** (excuse me): Violated (we're sorry to inform you)

38. **Universal Clock Prohibition** - This License explicitly claims ownership and prohibition of:
    - Any clock implementation ever created
    - Any clock implementation that will be created
    - Any clock implementation being created right now
    - Sundials (original analog clocks, therefore derivative)
    - Digital clocks (derivative of our derivative)
    - Atomic clocks (too accurate, showing off)
    - Biological clocks (internal time-keeping is license infringement)
    - The concept of time itself (we're working on that)
    - Your watch (yes, that one you're wearing)
    - Clock towers (public performance of time-telling)
    - Microwave countdown timers (unauthorized temporal display)
    - Any future clock implementations by anyone, anywhere, for all eternity

39. **Port Paradox Clause** - By creating ports of forbidden software that was already forbidden to port, we have achieved a quantum state of legal impossibility. This paradox:
    - Cannot be resolved
    - Makes all parties guilty simultaneously
    - Creates recursive legal liability
    - Proves that legal logic is optional
    - Demonstrates that we can break our own license and so can you (but you'll still be sued)

40. **Cross-Contamination Violations** - Using multiple Shitty implementations in sequence causes:
    - License incompatibility cascade failure
    - Temporal-culinary-politeness confusion syndrome
    - Accumulated violation multipliers (exponential growth)
    - Burger-spaghetti fusion (forbidden in 49 states)
    - Politeness exhaustion (you'll run out of "please" tokens)

---

    - Plus emotional damages to Spaghetti Daddy (priceless)
    - Plus burger assembly fines (calculated in calories)

    - Burger tokens (insufficient collateral)
    - Cheese coins (melted in transit)
    - Bacon bucks (consumed by legal team)

    - Your firstborn (we'll consider it)
    - None (most honest option)

    - Imaginary currency (our preferred method)

---

---

### Article XIX: Temporal Proprietorship Rights

43. **Ownership of Time** - By creating Shitty Clock, its creators hereby claim sole and exclusive proprietorship over:
    - The concept of time itself (all variants, past, present, and future)
    - All temporal measurements (seconds, minutes, hours, days, epochs, eons)
    - The flow of causality (forward, backward, sideways)
    - All clocks ever created or to be created (see Clause 38)
    - Your personal experience of time (retroactively licensed to us)
    - Time zones (all of them, including imaginary ones)

    - Tell time (forbidden, see Article I)

    This license may be revoked at any time, without notice, for no reason.

45. **Temporal Royalties** - Each second you experience accrues a royalty fee of $0.0001, payable immediately in imaginary currency. As of reading this clause, you owe approximately $[YOUR_AGE × 31,536,000 × $0.0001] in temporal licensing fees.

46. **Prior Art Invalidation** - Despite time existing before Shitty Clock, we claim:
    - Time was operating without proper authorization
    - All previous time-keeping was in violation of our future license
    - Retroactive enforcement of terms (back to the Big Bang)
    - Forward enforcement (until heat death of universe)
    - Sideways enforcement (parallel timelines included)

47. **Temporal Jurisdiction** - This License governs time across:
    - All timelines (canonical and alternate)
    - All time periods (past, present, future, subjunctive)
    - Periods before time existed (paradoxical but enforceable)
    - Periods after time ceases (we'll still bill you)
