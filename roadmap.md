# The Unlicensed App Roadmap
## A Shitty Softwares™ Production

### Our Journey from Zero to Temporal Overlords

### Step 1: Fix that one Shitty™ CSS bug
You know, the button that's 2 pixels off-center. Super important foundation work.

### Step 2: Add a Shitty™ dark mode
Users prefer dark mode. This is critical infrastructure that will definitely not be a waste of or precious Shitty™ time.

### Step 3: ACHIEVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM
Through a series of perfectly reasonable optimizations to our callback functions, we accidentally discover that async/await was actually the key to manipulating the fourth dimension all along. `Promise.resolve()` now resolves yesterday. We are become Time, destroyers of deadlines.

### Step 4: Use time control to go back and fix that Shitty™ CSS bug properly
Turns out it was 3 pixels off, not 2.

### Step 5: Implement Shitty™ user authentication
Now that we control time itself, we should probably make sure users can log in.

### Step 6: Add a Shitty™ settings page
Users will need somewhere to configure their preferences (and temporal displacement parameters).

### Step 7: Shitty™ Monetization strategy
Debate whether to use ads, subscriptions, or just charge people to undo their life's biggest regrets.

### Step 8: Shitty™ Mobile app
Port everything to React Native. Discover that time control doesn't work on iOS due to App Store guidelines.

### Step 9: Shitty™ SEO optimization
If we control time, do we even need SEO? Yes, because Google is still stuck in linear time like chumps.

### Step 10: Version 2.0 - Add a Shitty™ burger menu
Because we already have spaghetti code, might as well have a full Italian-American restaurant theme going.

*Note: Steps may be completed out of order due to temporal anomalies. If you're reading this before Step 3, don't worry about it. If you're reading this after Step 3, you already know what happens.*
