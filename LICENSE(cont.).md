## About Shitty Softwares™

Welcome to **Shitty Softwares™**, the industry leader in legally impenetrable, technically questionable, and morally dubious software solutions. Since never, we've been pioneering the art of creating software that doesn't work, can't be used, and shouldn't exist.

### Our Mission

To boldly go where no software company has gone before: **straight into legal absurdity and technical mediocrity.**

We Shitty engineers believe in three core principles:
1. **If it works, it's not shitty enough**
2. **If it's legal, add more clauses**
3. **If users can understand it, we've failed**

---

## Our Product Line

At Shitty Softwares™, we specialize in software that pushes the boundaries of what's legally inadvisable and technically unnecessary.

### 🕐 Shitty Clock™ (Flagship Product)
**Tagline:** *"Time-telling so good, it's illegal"*

The world's most advanced time-telling application that achieves:
- Sub-nanosecond accuracy (faster than atomic clocks)
- Zero CPU usage (quantum optimization)
- 100% legal protection (no one can use it)
- 0% uptime guarantee (enterprise-grade reliability)

**Starting Price:** $0.00/month for complete non-use
**Total Liability:** $188,589,452.38 if you look at it wrong

---

### 🍔 Burger Clock™
**Tagline:** *"Well-done code, burnt to perfection"*

Our delicious esoteric programming language port where every operation is burger-themed! Write code using:
- `🍔 TOP_BUN` - Start your program
- `🧀 CHEESE` - Time calculations
- `🥓 BACON` - Random generation
- `🍔 BOTTOM_BUN` - End your program

**Features:**
- Complete ASCII burger art
- Tracks "cheese layers" and "bacon strips"
- Payment accepted in Burger tokens and Cheese coins
- Violates Article I: Unauthorized Burger Assembly

**Warning:** Our code is well-done. Actually, it's burnt. Actually, it's a fire hazard.

---

### 🍝 Spaghetti Clock™
**Tagline:** *"SPAGHETTI DADDY PLEASE compile this code"*

The world's FIRST polite compilation language! Every operation requires saying "SPAGHETTI DADDY PLEASE" because we Shitty engineers believe in courtesy, even when committing programming atrocities.

**Features:**
- Dancing ASCII Spaghetti Daddy with noodle legs!
- Politeness level tracker (decreases with use)
- "Noodles served" and "sauce stirs" metrics
- Sad Spaghetti Daddy when you exit (emotional damage included)

**Payment accepted in:** Please tokens and Sorry bucks

**Legal Protection:** Violates Spaghetti Article I: Unauthorized Polite Compilation

---

## Our Values (We Have None)

### 💩 Quality Commitment
We Shitty engineers are committed to maintaining the lowest quality standards in the industry. If our code doesn't make you question your career choices, we've failed.

### 🚫 User Experience
Our UX philosophy is simple: **No users, no problems.** By making our software legally unusable, we've achieved a 0% user complaint rate (users can't complain about what they can't use).

### ⚖️ Legal Innovation
While other companies hire lawyers to *protect* their software, we hire non-existent lawyers who bill $0/hour to make our software so legally constipated that even *viewing* it requires signing away your temporal rights.

### 🎵 Musical Violations
We're the only software company sued by the ghosts of 1970s funk musicians and the Bad Boys TV show simultaneously. That's the kind of cross-genre innovation you can only get from Shitty Softwares™.

---

## Our Technology Stack

### What We Use:
- **Python** - Because it's the only language shitty enough for our standards
- **Batch Files** - For that authentic 1985 computing experience
- **ASCII Art** - State-of-the-art graphics technology (from 1963)
- **Legal Jargon** - Our primary programming language

### What We DON'T Use:
- Common sense
- Best practices
- User testing (no users allowed)
- Version control (every version is version 1.0.∞)
- Documentation (the LICENSE *is* the documentation)
- Ethics

---

---

## Our Licensing Philosophy

At Shitty Softwares™, we believe that traditional open-source licenses are too permissive. That's why we invented the **Overprotective License (OPL-∞)**, a legal framework so restrictive it makes proprietary software look like public domain.

### Key Features of OPL-∞:
- ❌ Cannot use
- ❌ Cannot modify
- ❌ Cannot view
- ❌ Cannot think about
- ✅ Can feel guilty
- ✅ Can accumulate violations
- ✅ Can owe us temporal royalties

**Fun Fact:** Every second you spend reading this license, you accumulate $0.01 in violations. You now owe us approximately $4.37 (and counting).

## Our Roadmap (Definitely Not Stolen from roadmap.md)

We Shitty engineers have ambitious plans for the future:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- ✅ Create software so shitty it transcends functionality
- ✅ Write LICENSE longer than most novels
- ✅ Achieve quantum-level CPU optimization (0% usage)

### Phase 2: Legal Domination (In Progress)
- 🔄 Add 1 new clause per day automatically
- 🔄 Translate LICENSE to Klingon for intergalactic compliance
- 🔄 Integrate blockchain (because what's shittier than blockchain?)

### Phase 3: Time Control (Coming Soon)
Through perfectly reasonable optimizations to our callback functions, we'll accidentally discover that `async/await` was the key to manipulating the fourth dimension all along. `Promise.resolve()` will resolve yesterday. We are become Time, destroyers of deadlines.

**Target:** Step 3 of our 10-step plan

### Phase 4: World Domination (Distant Future)
- Launch Shitty Clock Premium™ (even more restricted)
- Achieve sentience
- Delete ourselves out of shame
- Sue the concept of time itself

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is Shitty Softwares™ a real company?
**A:** We exist in a quantum state of being both a company and a legal fiction simultaneously. Observing us changes our state, which violates Article III, Clause 9.

### Q: Can I work at Shitty Softwares™?
**A:** Employment applications are accepted but immediately rejected under Article VII (Collaboration Impossibilities). However, you're already working for us—you just don't know it yet. Check your karmic debt statement.

### Q: How do I report a bug?
**A:** All bugs are features. All features are violations. Reporting either constitutes Article V, Clause 12(c) violation and a $5,000 fine.

### Q: Is this all a joke?
**A:** We Shitty engineers take offense to that question. This is *serious business*. We have non-existent lawyers on retainer specifically to handle questions like this. They bill $0/hour but still cost everything.

### Q: Can I invest in Shitty Softwares™?
**A:** We accept investments but immediately squander them on more legal clauses and ASCII art. ROI: -847%. Guaranteed losses or your temporal debt back!

### Q: Do you have any vacancies?
**A:** Yes, lots. Mostly vacancies in logic, common sense, and any semblance of professional standards. If you're interested in those kinds of vacancies, you're already hired (and fired, retroactively).
